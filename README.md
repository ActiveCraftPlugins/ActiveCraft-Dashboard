# ActiveCraft-Dashboard
An elegant way to manage your Minecraft server remotely.

### How does it work?
The Minecraft plugin starts a server parallel to the Minecraft server which works as the an interface. Through the AC-Dashboard app users can do all sorts of stuff like managing players, checking hardware workload or accessing the console.
Server and client communicate over HTTP GET and POST. For security purposes we recommend activating HTTPS. A guide how to setup HTTPS on your server can be found [here](https://github.com/CPlaiz/ActiveCraft-Dashboard/wiki/How-to-activate-HTTPS-on-your-server).
